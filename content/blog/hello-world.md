Welcome to my blog *Loops of Thought*. This name was inspired by a few things: first is the book "I Am a Strange Loop". I also wanted a mix of programming lingo and mind/psych terms and came to this.

I'm Jon, a software engineer with a background in backend and data roles. I have many passions all surrounding learning new things, and in this blog I will talk and teach about them.

Some of the entries will be purely technical, some will be just me rambling about stuff but I promise all will have added value to you the readers!

## What to Expect in The Near Future
- Updates on projects I'm working on
- Technical tutorials and how-to guides
- Code Walkthroughs
- Product Releases (I am working on a few things both open-source and not)
- Thoughts on Science, Psychology, and Anything else that interests me

Stay tuned for more content!
