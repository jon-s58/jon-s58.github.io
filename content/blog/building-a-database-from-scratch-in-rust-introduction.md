Welcome to my first blog series where I will talk about the development of jdb, a database I am writing from scratch in Rust. You might be asking yourselves why? And I ask back, why not?

The main goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of databases (further than reading database internals and going over other projects) and of Rust, a language I like.

To start, this database will not be anything special, but as I go along I might insert some of my own ideas to make it unique.

The first part of this series will be about the storage layer: how it works, the options for storing tables, my decisions, and the reasons I chose them. So if databases interest you and you'd like a deeper understanding of them, be sure to wait and read my future blog entries.
